# Gemstone Price Prediction Regression Project


#### This repo is a model that forecasts gemstone prices using the Sklearn and Tensorflow/Keras repositories.


This project aims to build a price prediction model using a data set to predict the prices of stones using Regression Model. The dataset contains prices of stones with different characteristics. These characteristics include the weight, cut shape, clarity grade and colour shade of the stone. The regression model is used to predict the price of a particular stone using a combination of these characteristics. This model can be used to understand price changes in the gemstone industry and can be used to give customers or investors an idea of the likely value of their stones.
